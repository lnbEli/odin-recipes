    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>100g butter</li>
      <li>1 large onion</li>
      <li>1 head of broccoli</li>
      <li>350ml chicken stock</li>
      <li>150ml single cream</li>
      <li>350g all-butter puff pastry</li>
      <li>400g cooked chicken</li>
      <li>1 free-range egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 200°C/fan180°C/gas 6. Melt 25g of the butter in a
        large frying pan, add the onion and cook slowly for 15 minutes or until
        softened and caramelised. Remove from the heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Steam the broccoli for 3-4 minutes until al dente, refresh in a bowl of
        iced water, then drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the remaining butter in a large pan over a medium heat, add the
        flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring well to combine. Gradually add the
        stock, whisking constantly until it thickens. If it goes a bit lumpy,
        don’t worry; just whisk briskly until smooth. Reduce the heat and simmer
        for 3-4 minutes. Season well and add the mustard. Stir in the cream,
        then simmer for a further minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the broccoli and chicken to the sauce and stir well. Transfer the
        mixture to a 1.5 litre pie dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the pastry out to the thickness of a pound coin, making sure it is
        large enough to cover the top of the dish. Brush the edges of the dish
        with a little beaten egg and place the pastry on top. Brush the pastry
        with beaten egg. Use a sharp knife to make a small hole in the centre of
        the pastry to allow the steam to escape, then cook in the oven for 30-35
        minutes until the pastry is golden.
